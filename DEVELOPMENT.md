## **3. Understanding Core Components**

### **Field Validation**

#### What It Does
Field validation is the process of applying one or more validation conditions to a specific form field. It ensures the field meets the requirements defined in the validation rules.

#### How It Works
1. **Validation Rules**:
   Each field has associated rules defining conditions like "Required," "Length Check," "Regex Match," etc.

2. **FieldValidator**:
   The `FieldValidator` service contains methods for validating individual conditions.

3. **Example Flow**:
   - A rule is defined for the `email` field:
     ```javascript
     {
       fieldId: "email",
       conditions: [
         { type: "REQUIRED", errorMessage: "Email is required" },
         { type: "REGEX", regex: "^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$", errorMessage: "Invalid email format" }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - During validation, each condition is checked using `FieldValidator` methods:
     ```javascript
     const field = { fieldId: "email", value: "john.doe@example.com" };
     const condition = { type: "REQUIRED" };
     const result = FieldValidator.validateRequired(field, condition);
     if (result) {
       console.error("Validation error:", result.message);
     }
     ```

#### Key Methods in `FieldValidator`
- **`validateRequired(field, condition)`**:
  Ensures the field is not empty.
- **`validateLength(field, condition)`**:
  Checks if the field value length is within a specified range.
- **`validateRegex(field, condition)`**:
  Validates the field value against a regex pattern.
- **`validateDependency(field, condition, formData)`**:
  Ensures the field meets conditions based on the values of other fields.

### **Validation Controller**

#### What It Does
The `ValidationController` orchestrates the validation process. It applies the rules defined for each field and aggregates the results.

#### How It Works
1. **Load Rules**:
   The controller takes the form data and validation rules as input.

2. **Apply Field Validation**:
   It uses `FieldValidator` to validate each field against its conditions.

3. **Aggregate Results**:
   Errors are collected into a `ValidationResult` object, which can be returned to the caller.

#### Example Flow
Herefs how the `ValidationController` validates a form:
```javascript
const formData = {
  email: "john.doe@example",
  password: "1234"
};

const rules = [
  {
    fieldId: "email",
    conditions: [
      { type: "REQUIRED", errorMessage: "Email is required" },
      { type: "REGEX", regex: "^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$", errorMessage: "Invalid email format" }
    ]
  },
  {
    fieldId: "password",
    conditions: [
      { type: "REQUIRED", errorMessage: "Password is required" },
      { type: "LENGTH_CHECK", minLength: 8, errorMessage: "Password must be at least 8 characters long" }
    ]
  }
];

const controller = new ValidationController();
controller.validateForm(formData, rules)
  .then(result => {
    if (result.hasErrors) {
      console.error("Validation errors:", result.details);
    } else {
      logger.log("Validation passed!");
    }
  });
```

#### Key Methods in `ValidationController`
- **`validateForm(formData, rules)`**:
  Validates the entire form based on the provided rules.
- **`applyRule(field, rule)`**:
  Validates a single field against a single rule.

## **4. Development Workflow**

Use the following commands during development:

#### Run Tests:
```bash
npm test
```

#### Build the Minified File:
```bash
npm run build
```

## **5. Adding Features**

### Steps to Add a New Feature
1. **Identify the Module**:
   - For field-specific logic, update `FieldValidator`.
   - For overall rule application, update `ValidationController`.

2. **Write the Feature**:
   - Add the new functionality in the appropriate file.
   - Follow the existing modular structure.

3. **Test the Feature**:
   - Add test cases in `/tests` for the new functionality.

---

## **6. Writing and Running Tests**

1. Create a test file in `/tests`:
   ```bash
   touch tests/new-feature.test.js
   ```

2. Write test cases:
   ```javascript
   describe("New Feature", () => {
     test("should validate custom logic", () => {
       const result = newFeatureFunction();
       expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
     });
   });
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

---

## **7. Building the Library**

Use Webpack to bundle the library:
```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be generated in `/dist/validation-engine.min.js`.
